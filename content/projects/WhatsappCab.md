An end-to-end Cab Booking system, built as a part of the Ola Hack Day Hackathon in 36 hours where a user can provide details for booking a cab using WhatsApp communication, either through text, location or voice (transcription was done using Speechmatics Speech to Text API), and the booking details will be communicated using WhatsApp.
